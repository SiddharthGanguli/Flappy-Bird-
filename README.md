I made this project to practice **C# scripting, Unity physics, UI, and game logic**, and to understand how a simple game loop works.

##  What I Learned
While making this project, I got hands-on experience with:
- Unity 2D Game Development basics
- C# scripting for player movement, scoring, and collisions
- Rigidbody2D and physics components
- Prefabs and spawning objects dynamically
- Simple UI: Score display, Game Over screen
- Scene management in Unity

This was my first time building a complete playable game in Unity, and I learned a lot through trial and error!  

## Project Structure
- **Assets/** → Contains all sprites, scripts, and prefabs
- **ProjectSettings/** → Unity project configuration files
- **Packages/** → Unity package dependencies
- **Flappy_bird.app** → Built game (MacOS)
- **Flappy Blorb.sln** → Visual Studio solution
- **.gitignore** → Git ignore rules for Unity
